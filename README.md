# Event Registration System

This is a simple event registration system where users can register for events, providing their personal information and selecting events they wish to participate in. The system uses HTML for the front-end, PHP for server-side processing, and MySQL for database storage.

## Features

- **User Registration**: Users can provide their personal details such as name, email, phone number, address, age, gender, institute name, course, and graduating year.
- **Event Registration**: Users can register for multiple events, specify their event slots, registration type (Individual/Group), and any special requirements.
- **Data Storage**: User information and event registrations are stored in a MySQL database.

## Prerequisites

Before running the system, make sure you have the following installed:

- MySQL database server
- A code editor (e.g., VSCode, Sublime Text)
